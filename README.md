# Allen_SDK_Intern_Project
This Repo contains files pertaining to my 2017 summer internship project at the Allen Institute.

Allen_SDK_User_Usability_Chart.xml: 
Contains a diagram that represents qualatative analysis on user interaction with the Allen SDK to solve a set of data-retrieval tasks.      Three subjects were observed with a goal of completing 3 tasks within 40 minutes. Qualatative data was collected and streamlined to find commonalitites between how subjects interfaced with the SDK. This was then used to form insights that will point in the direction necessary to build an effective and effecient, easy-to-use SDK.
